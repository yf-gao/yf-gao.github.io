Hi, I am Yunfan Gao (高云帆), an industrial Ph.D. student at Bosch Research supervised by Dr. Niels van Duijkeren. I am also in the [syscop](https://www.syscop.de/) group at [Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/), advised by Prof. [Moritz Diehl](https://www.syscop.de/people/moritz-diehl). My research topic is "Safe Motion Planning in Dynamic, Uncertain Environments". Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from Fudan University in 2019 and my master's degree in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zurich in 2022.
